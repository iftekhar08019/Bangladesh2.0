            Making money is happiness. And that's a great incentive. Making
            other people happy is super-happiness. My greatest challenge has
            been to change the mindset of people. Mindsets play strange tricks
            on us. We see things the way our minds have instructed our eyes to
            see. The most difficult part was to tell people that there is
            nothing wrong in making money, but there is something wrong when
            money making is not connected to the sense of social consciousness.
            Social business is about waking up to the needs of others and
            thinking about others as much as you think about yourself. It is
            about using our capacity, our expertise, and our creativity to solve
            global problems of health, education, and poverty. It is a challenge
            to show how social business can address these issues in a
            financially sustainable way.
