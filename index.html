                <p class="card-description"> Making money is happiness. And that's a great incentive. Making other people happy is super-happiness. My greatest challenge has been to change the mindset of people. Mindsets play strange tricks on us. We see things the way our minds have instructed our eyes to see. The most difficult part was to tell people that there is nothing wrong in making money, but there is something wrong when money making is not connected to the sense of social consciousness. Social business is about waking up to the needs of others and thinking about others as much as you think about yourself. It is about using our capacity, our expertise, and our creativity to solve global problems of health, education, and poverty. It is a challenge to show how social business can address these issues in a financially sustainable way. </p>
